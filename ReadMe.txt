None official release. 

This version will most likely not work you may not even be able to create a new project.
Just stick to the helloworld project patch to play with.

This release is meant for working out bugs/tinkering and would not recommend using the patch in
its current state for a final product. Do not rely on its stability!

Working gui items in this version:

Known bugs:
Scene changes might crash after "drawnnumber_motion: scalar" in console.
When new items are added the item name may stay blank.  Rename the item and re-build to fix this.
Only the Item Header label shows when a items is created. Adjust the item size and re-build to fix this.
Header label shows as "symbol". Assign the header text label to fix this.
